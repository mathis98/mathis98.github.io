It will be updated continuously based on the newest information.</p><h2 id="polaroid">Polaroid</h2>
<h3 id="sx-70">SX-70</h3>
<p>My first Polaroid was an SX-70 from the 70s. Specifically the Alpha model without Tripod mount. It is a fantastic camera as its lens is completely made of glass and its body of metal. Also, it is a shutter lens reflex camera which means when viewing through the gorgeous viewfinder you look directly out of the lens which makes it a joy to compose images. Finally, it completely folds down which is a nice party trick and makes it nice and portable. When folding up it oftentimes feels like I am breaking the camera as it requires a little more force as you would think. It is really sturdily built, though. One downside, compared to later Polaroid cameras, is that you need to set the focus manually which can be especially annoying in suboptimal lighting conditions. As an upgrade to the very first SX-70 model this model comes with a guide and additionally with markings helping you to focus. After buying this camera I also got some original accessories like a <strong>self-timer</strong>, some <strong>flashes</strong>, a <strong>sun shade</strong>, a <strong>flash diffuser</strong>, the <strong>1.5 Tele Lens</strong>, a <strong>tripod mount</strong>, and a <strong>cable release</strong>. The most worthwile ones in my opinion are the self timer, tripod mount, and cable release. I was able to take some gorgeous selfies and nighttime photos using these. As the camera does not have a tripod mount the tripod adapter is absolutely necessary in my opinion. The sun shade is also handy in really bright conditions. The tele Lens does enable some nice portrait photos but I do not use it too often. I personally never used the flash diffuser as I never took closeups using flash. I got a bag of 10 original flash bars for cheap. Each of them contains 10 flash bulbs. The way they work is that the bulbs burn through everytime you take a photo. They do produce a super bright flash in the process. What I found is that pictures using flash usually turn out too bright for me. When I correct the exposure time down they look good. Also it is hard to set the focus correctly in dark conditions.</p>
<h3 id="600">600</h3>
<p>Later I also started using a 600 camera. Namely, the Polaroid Impulse. Since it is from the 80s it now comes with a full plastic body. Which makes it way lighter. The viewfinder is next to the actual lens which you always have to correct for when taking photos. It comes with a frog tongue which protects the photo in the first vulnerable moments when coming out. This camera does have a flash built in. Also focus is now fully automatic. For me this is a nice camera for taking quick snapshots as it determines automatically where to focus and if flash is needed. Photos usually turn out really well. Since there are a lot more 600 film based polaroids this type of film is more ubiquitous and more easily found. In Berlin it is possible to find both. For example <a href="https://safelightberlin.com/">Safelight</a> or <a href="https://www.fotoimpex.com">Fotoimpex</a>. At some point I would like to get a filter for my SX-70 to be able to also shoot the higher ASA 600 film with it.</p>
<h2 id="super-8">Super 8</h2>
<p>The Super 8 camera I own is the Bolex 155 Macrozoom. It was built in Switzerland in the 60s. It is built like a tank and makes a fantastic design piece. It is the successor to the Bolex 150 with the main advantage that it is possible to focus anything from a distance of 1 inch up to infinity. For the motor it takes simple AA batteries. The only issue is the light meter which requires two PX-13 1.35v mercury cells. Since mercury was found to be dangerous these are not produced anymore. Even though they made fantastic batteries. The &quot;official&quot; replacement is the 625 battery. Unfortunately it is 1.5V which will cause the light meter to always be slightly off and the resulting film to be underexposed. One option is to manually correct during filming. Since Super 8 film and development is quite expensive I went for a different route. The <a href="https://www.weincell.com/">WeinCell</a> zinc-air battery comes with exactly the same voltage. Two downsides are that it is more expensive and it will deplete even when not used. That is why it comes with a tab. Be sure to buy extra as they are not available everywhere. I already had the problem that I wanted to start filming while on holidays and my WeinCell was empty. Apparently some people build adapters for other kinds of batteries which I might try at some points as it is a cheaper route. I usually buy film at <a href="https://clickundsurr.de">Click &amp; Surr</a> a nice store in Berlin focusing on Super8 filmography. You can get the film directly with <a href="http://andecfilm.de/">Andec</a> development included. They also sell lots of other Super8 accessories like splicers, film leaders, film spools, cameras, and projectors. The nice thing is that their cameras and projectors are thoroughly tested and guaranteed. My camera came out cheaper through eBay. In order to test the functionality I needed to buy, film, and develop a whole film with it. So, had it not worked the Click &amp; Surr route would have been cheaper.</p>
<h2 id="hi8">Hi8</h2>
<p>As a high camera I own the SONY CCD-TR750E from the 90s. I was able to buy a new Hi8 casette from Amazon. As they ceased production some years ago it was held in storage. Nevertheless, it works marvelously. For digitization I use a simple S-Video to USB converter similar to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Converter-Digital-Capture-Support-Windows/dp/B087TDN2FL">this one</a>. Using OBS it is simple to digitize that way. After digitization I just record on the same tape again. That way Hi8 is a cheap format for filming analog film. Quality will probably regress once I took many recordings. At that point I would just buy a new tape.</p>
<h2 id="double-super-8">Double Super 8</h2>
<p>I inherited a Soviet Krasnogorsk Double Super 8 camera.<br>
Double Super 8 is an exciting format since it has a significantly longer runtime than super 8 due to a trick. The actual film is 16mm wide. Only half of it gets exposed at one time. After half has been exposed the film needs to be placed into the camera in reverse to expose the other half. At the end after development the film gets spliced in half and attached at the ends to obtain double the runtime.</p>
<h3 id="notes-on-development">Notes on Development</h3>
<p>It is not trivial to get Super 8 and Double Super 8 film developed. Luckily in Berlin, my hometown, a lab developing all kinds of motion picture film survived. I can only highly recommend to get the film developed at <a href="http://andecfilm.de/">Andec</a>. It is also possible to send the film via mail if you are not in Berlin and they will send it back developed. Digital Scans will be provided via DropBox. This lab does develop everything from Super 8 all the way to 35mm cinematic motion picture film. Also, I believe it is the only lab in the world that offers transfering negative Super 8 to positive Super 8 for projection. I usually directly film on positive film (color reversal) as I really enjoy the experience of projecting the developed film in my living room. It just gives another feel to it. As projector I bought a simple old Eumig.</p>

It will be constantly updated whenever something changes. The old setup will still be included so you can see the history nicely. As of right now I have two pieces of hardware acting as servers. One is primarily a NAS server while the other runs Home Assistant and some other additional services.</p><h2 id="1-nas-server">1. NAS Server</h2>
<p>This server acts as a NAS. After doing some research in 2022 I decided to go with FreeNAS as it seemed to fit all my requirements. The most important ones were that it is open-source and free. Therefore, it is truly customizable by the user. Based on FreeBSD it also supports a plethora of additional software. Last year I actually upgraded to TrueNAS Scale. It is based on Linux and thus compatible to even more software. The upgrade was smooth and it also runs with much less effort than FreeNAS. More on that later.</p>
<p>As the hardware options are sheer endless I drew inspiration from the <a href="https://www.truenas.com/community/resources/hardware-recommendations-guide.12/">FreeNAS community hardware guide</a>. The following is the hardware I went with:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> Supermicro X11SSH-F with a 1151 Intel CPU Socket</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>  Intel Core i3-6100 (2x 3.70GHz)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> Samsung 16 GB (2x8GB) DDR4-2133 ECC PC4-17000E M391A1G43DB0-CPBQ</li>
<li><strong>HDD:</strong> Seagate ST4000VN000 4TB (3x)</li>
<li><strong>SSD:</strong> Samsung PM961 256GB M.2 2280 SSD</li>
<li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Dell Precision T1650 320 Watt ATX Power Supply</li>
<li><strong>Case:</strong> Enermax Staray ATX MidiTower Black</li>
</ol>
<p>First, let me shortly describe my usage so you can get a feel of what I evaluate the hardware on. My main usage of the NAS is as a media server. For that I use the superb and open source software &quot;JellyFin&quot;. I tied in Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, Prowlarr, and Overseerr (actually the Jellyseerr fork) for smooth downloading. Next, I run NextCloud as my own personal cloud file server. To this instance I also sync contacts, and calendar. I also run Immich, a nice image gallery, for accessing and organising my images. Additionally I use the server for backups and run some other small stuff. I will also release a post that goes more in-depth. This will also describe which other software I tried out, why I stuck with the one above and what I like and don&apos;t like about it. Now, let&apos;s continue with an evaluation of my hardware based on my workload.</p>
<p>The Supermicro Motherboard is a sturdy workforce as its intended use is also in servers. I went with an ECC capable motherboard for extra peace of mind. Accordingly I also chose 16GB of ECC RAM. 16GB performs nicely. However, by adding more and more functionality to the server at times the RAM will be completely used. Therefore, I plan to upgrade to 32GB in the forseeable future. The X11SSH-F motherboard luckily provides me with 2 additional RAM slots.</p>
<p>The processor is totally sufficient for my usage. It is able to run all the services with ease and usage is barely maxed out.</p>
<p>The HDD I mainly chose since I had one of these lying around from an old Synology NAS. While Synology software is definitely super nice I wanted more customizability and thus went the route of FreeNAS, and now TrueNAS Scale. I opted for 3 to be able to run RAIDZ so when one of the hard drives fails I still have all the data. Sizewise I completely underestimated what I would need and almost all of it is now used up. As it is not straightforward to add more storage to ZFS RAIDZ I plan on adding 3 4TB HDDs in addition effectively doubling the size. This time probably with a higher RAIDZ level.</p>
<p>I chose an M.2 SSD mainly for the operating system and swap. The capacity is not that big but by far enough for this utility. It is able to boot TrueNAS Scale rapidly and runs efficiently.</p>
<p>The power supply I chose mainly based on its 80+ Gold rating. As the server is intended to be on 24/7 power consumption is actually important. So far I have no complaints. It is able to power my selected hardware nicely.</p>
<p>As I bought a used case I did not care too much about specifics. My demands were mainly that it is a) cheap, and b) able to house all the components. The Enermax case fit that bill nicely. I like the feature of tool-less HDD mounts. I also added 3 additional fans to keep everything nice and cool.</p>
<p><strong>To summarize:</strong> I am quite happy with my hardware of choice and would only recommend it. The only thing I should have definitely sized bigger is the amount of storage and possibly RAM. As I built this server myself it is easy to upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="2-raspberry-pi">2. Raspberry Pi</h2>
<p>I got a Raspberry Pi 4B with 8GB RAM. As this is quite a nice piece of hardware I also use it as a server for home automation mainly. On it I run Home Assistant to control and monitor all my smart home devices as well as my NAS. Furthermore, I run a reverse proxy on this Raspberry Pi to connect to all the services running in my local network through only one open port. I reach my network through a dynamic DNS. I will describe this setup in more detail in a future post as this one focuses on hardware.</p>
<p>I house this Raspberry Pi in a case with an included fan and heatsinks. As this fan got quite loud I usually disconnect it. The Pi still keeps cool enough with the heatsinks alone. With 8GB RAM it is more than enough to run my Home Automation.</p>

Instead, the coffee grounds are immersed into cold water for a prolonged period (above 12 hours). That way the distinct coffee aroma gets passed onto the water.</p><p>This method, also called dutch coffee, sounds strange to most. Isn&apos;t coffee usually brewed near boiling temperature? While that is the usual way for preparing coffee &quot;brewing&quot; cold comes with some advantages. The first is that coffee beans contain an immense amount of distinct aromas. Some of these get burned at the usual higher temperatures. Cold brewed coffee will also have less acidity which makes it a plus for people normal coffee is to acid for. </p><p>For these reasons cold brew coffee has become really popular recently. After all it produces a nice smooth glass of coffee. It is by no means a new invention, though. It is likely that the dutch brought it to Japan as a means of drinking coffee on their ships without boiling. After it got popularized in Japan, especially Kyoto. From there it became a global phenomenon a few years back.</p><p> This is my simple recipe for cold brew coffee I have used for many years. It yields around 500ml.</p><h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>
<hr>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>50g Coffee Beans</li>
<li>500ml Cold Water</li>
</ul>
<p>This produces a high-concentration coffee. I prefer it that way. Feel free to add water for dillution according to your tastes. It is also possible to produce an even higher concentration and thus gain more cold brew in the end.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Grind</strong> coffee beans quite coarse. I use ~35-40 clicks on my Comandante C40 MK3.</li>
<li><strong>Add</strong> the <strong>coffee</strong> grounds to a jar large enough for stirring.</li>
<li><strong>Add water</strong> to jar after filtering. I use a simple Brita filter.</li>
<li><strong>Cover</strong> and <strong>put into fridge</strong> between 12 and 24 hours. Stir at random intervals.</li>
<li>Use coffee filter to <strong>filter</strong> out coffee grounds. I just use my V60 filters. Either drink resulting cold brew or store it airtight. Another fun twist is to freeze the cold brew in a ice cube mold to obtain cold brew ice cubes. These can be added to all kinds of iced coffee drinks. I particularly like doing a cold brew Tonic with cold brew ice cubes.</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy</strong>! Either pure, add milk, or anything you prefer.</li>
</ol>
