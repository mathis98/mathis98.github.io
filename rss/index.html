Instead, the coffee grounds are immersed into cold water for a prolonged period (above 12 hours). That way the distinct coffee aroma gets passed onto the water.</p><p>This method, also called dutch coffee, sounds strange to most. Isn&apos;t coffee usually brewed near boiling temperature? While that is the usual way for preparing coffee &quot;brewing&quot; cold comes with some advantages. The first is that coffee beans contain an immense amount of distinct aromas. Some of these get burned at the usual higher temperatures. Cold brewed coffee will also have less acidity which makes it a plus for people normal coffee is to acid for. </p><p>For these reasons cold brew coffee has become really popular recently. After all it produces a nice smooth glass of coffee. It is by no means a new invention, though. It is likely that the dutch brought it to Japan as a means of drinking coffee on their ships without boiling. After it got popularized in Japan, especially Kyoto. From there it became a global phenomenon a few years back.</p><p> This is my simple recipe for cold brew coffee I have used for many years. It yields around 500ml.</p><h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>
<hr>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>50g Coffee Beans</li>
<li>500ml Cold Water</li>
</ul>
<p>This produces a high-concentration coffee. I prefer it that way. Feel free to add water for dillution according to your tastes. It is also possible to produce an even higher concentration and thus gain more cold brew in the end.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Grind</strong> coffee beans quite coarse. I use ~35-40 clicks on my Comandante C40 MK3.</li>
<li><strong>Add</strong> the <strong>coffee</strong> grounds to a jar large enough for stirring.</li>
<li><strong>Add water</strong> to jar after filtering. I use a simple Brita filter.</li>
<li><strong>Cover</strong> and <strong>put into fridge</strong> between 12 and 24 hours. Stir at random intervals.</li>
<li>Use coffee filter to <strong>filter</strong> out coffee grounds. I just use my V60 filters. Either drink resulting cold brew or store it airtight. Another fun twist is to freeze the cold brew in a ice cube mold to obtain cold brew ice cubes. These can be added to all kinds of iced coffee drinks. I particularly like doing a cold brew Tonic with cold brew ice cubes.</li>
<li><strong>Enjoy</strong>! Either pure, add milk, or anything you prefer.</li>
</ol>
